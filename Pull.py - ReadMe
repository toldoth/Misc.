To use pull.py you must download a webpage(right click, save as), then running
the script on said html file. Pull.py will get the locations of the images from
the html file, the benifit of using this over just using the folder with the images
is that this script put them in the order they apear in html. Ive only tested
it slightly and on linux so expect bugs, I used no platform specific codes.
This is python3 btw.

This script is meant to be used as a template and isnt by any means complete or
fully functional, as title including "Fractional" would indicate
